# alpha-beta-gamma
Alpha beta gamma test for the y3 master catalog

code/abg.py: solves the fitting problem. Defining a chisq function, for alpha,beta and delta constant

code/abg_scaledependet.py: solves system of equations for each angular bin, so alpha, beta and delta are scale dependent

code/galaxies_rstars_corr.py: computes correlations between metacal galaxies and reserved stars

code/reserved_stars_corr.py: computes autocorrelation of reserved stars
